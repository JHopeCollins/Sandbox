look at how to combine:
   fv/dg UnsteadyField
   fv/dg timeseries_plotting
   fv/dg equation class

look at multiple inheritance
   eg for fv.fields.UnsteadyField1D inheriting from:
      fv.fields.Field1D
      general.fields.UnsteadyField1D

move ODEintegrators and evolutions from fv to top folder ( maybe general )
